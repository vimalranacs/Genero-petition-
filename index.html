<h1>🎭 Genero Fest Student Petition</h1>
<p class="subtitle">A respectful student request for fair and inclusive participation.</p>

<!-- ================= PETITION CONTENT ================= -->

<div class="petition-box">

<h2>Why this petition exists</h2>

<p>
Genero is a 3-day college fest organized at ABES Engineering College.
Students appreciate the effort and enthusiasm behind organizing such a large
event. However, many students are facing genuine financial concerns regarding
the current ticket pricing.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>early bird ticket price is ₹1000</strong>, launched close to month-end —
a time when many students already manage expenses like hostel fees,
transportation, food, and academic costs.
</p>

<h3>📊 Estimated Collection</h3>

<div class="calculation">
If 5000–6000 tickets are sold:<br><br>
₹1000 × 5000 students = ₹50,00,000<br>
₹1000 × 6000 students = ₹60,00,000
</div>

<p>
Even with conservative estimates, the fest may generate
<strong>₹30–50 Lakhs+</strong> through ticket sales alone.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, sponsors are being approached and branding partnerships
are expected. Students therefore question whether such a high participation
fee is necessary.
</p>

<h3>🎓 Student Concerns</h3>

<ul>
<li>Many students rely on monthly allowances and cannot arrange ₹1000 instantly.</li>
<li>Early bird timing did not consider financial cycles of students.</li>
<li>College fests in many institutions remain free or low-cost for students.</li>
<li>High pricing may exclude a large section of students from participation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🙏 Our Requests</h3>

<ul>
<li>✅ Extend the early bird deadline</li>
<li>✅ Reduce early bird pricing</li>
<li>✅ Lower regular ticket price</li>
<li>✅ Ensure inclusivity so maximum students can participate</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
This petition is not against the fest or organizers.
It is a collective student voice requesting reconsideration
so Genero becomes a celebration accessible to everyone.
